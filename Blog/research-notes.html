		<h3 id="section-3">2022-06-21</h3>
		<p>The problem wasn’t my PATH. What I needed to do was:</p>
		<pre><code>$ cd Repos/pulp/pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain</code></pre>
		<p>This allowed me to run the configure command that was in the
		repository that we cloned earlier. Hopefully, if this completes

		<p>It did not complete successfully. I <del>may</del> have run out of

		<p>[If this still doesn’t work, try appending /opt/riscv/bin to the
		<em>beginning</em> of PATH, not the end.]</p>
		<p>IT WORKED!!! The successful one was the Newlib version, which uses

		<p>CISC architecture allows for “higher programming productivity” in

		<p>Since the PULP toolchain is for PULP architecture and not the Qemu

		instead:</p>
		<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain --recursive</code></pre>
		<p><em>Despite</em> what the README would have you believe, the
		<code>--recursive</code> <em>is</em> necessary to clone the

		<p>Next, as recommended, I installed dependencies.</p>

		<p>I got the riscv-gnu-toolchain built successfully using the following
		commands:</p>
		<pre><code>$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --enable-multilib
		$ sudo make</code></pre>
		<p>To verify that it built and configured correctly, I tried compiling
		my <code>hello.c</code> from my example bare metal C for ARM. That
		attempt produced the following result:</p>

		Hello World</a></h1>
		<p>After copying the included assembly into a file called
		<code>hello.s</code>, I created the makefile and <a
		href="https://github.com/michaeljclark/riscv-probe/blob/master/env/qemu-sifive_u/default.lds">linker
		script</a> <code>link.lds</code> as specified.</p>
		<p>It turns out that I had <strong><em>not,</em></strong> in fact,
		configured my toolchain correctly. I again tried the
		<code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code> steps for the
		<code>riscv-gnu-toolchain</code>, still with <code>/opt/riscv/bin</code>
		as my install directory.</p>
		<p>I had to try this several times, getting unhelpful
		<code>Error 1</code> and <code>Error 2</code> messages in the
		<code>make</code> process. On the advice of the README, I cleared out my
		install directory before trying to install again into the same
		directory. I tried the following, and this seemed to work:</p>
		<pre><code>$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --enable-multilib
		$ sudo make linux</code></pre>
		<p>The process teminated, and I verified that there were executable
		files in <code>/opt/riscv/bin</code>.</p>
		<h3 id="section-10">2022-07-15</h3>
		<p>I finally figured out how to invoke my newly configured
		<code>riscv-gcc</code>, with the following command:</p>
		<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc --help</code></pre>
		<p>This produced a help menu. I next tried to compile
		<code>hello.c</code>, and recieved this error message:</p>
		<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc ~/Desktop/hello.c

		riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc: error trying to exec &#39;cc1&#39;: execvp: No such file or directory</code></pre>
		<p>I then invoked verbose mode with the <code>-v</code> flag and tried
		compiling again, with this output:</p>
		<pre><code>Using built-in specs.
		COLLECT_GCC=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc

		riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc: error trying to exec &#39;cc1&#39;: execvp: No such file or directory</code></pre>
		<p>From this output, it seems that my
		<code>./configure --enable-multilib</code> flag had not, for whatever
		reason, configured multilib support. I did find it somewhat odd that
		there were no <code>riscv32-...</code> executables in
		<code>/opt/riscv/bin</code>, which was the first sign that it didn’t
		configure multilib. Since the <code>riscv-probe</code> requires a
		multilib installation, I’ll have to try again (but I’ll use a different
		install directory, because I <em>have</em> a working
		<code>riscv-gcc</code> right now, even if it’s only for the 64-bit
		architecture. –&gt; It seems that I didn’t read far enough on the
		toolchain README, and the Linux multilib cross-compiler uses the prefix
		<code>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-</code>, although it can target
		<em>both</em> 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Since I knew my 64-bit
		<code>virt</code> emulator was working, I opted to use that for my
		target.</p>
		<p>Let’s try to build our Assembly hello world, instead of C. Since I’ve
		tested the <code>virt</code> machine in Qemu, I’ll try targeting it with
		my assembler and linker. To do this, I looked up the <code>UART0</code>
		address for <code>virt</code>, which I found on line 85 of
		<code>qemu/hw/riscv/virt.c</code>:</p>
		<pre><code>static const MemMapEntry virt_memmap[] = {
		...
			[VIRT_UART0] =  {   0x10000000, 0x100   },
		...
		};</code></pre>
		<p>In accordance with this, I changed line 5 of <code>hello.s</code> to
		be</p>
		<pre><code>lui t0, 0x10000</code></pre>
		<p>since that is the line that loads our UART0 address into register t0.
		As noted in <a href="/src/Assembly_Hello/riscv-hello-asm_annotated">my
		annotations of this assembly</a>, <code>lui</code> loads the given
		20-bit immediate into the upper 20 bits of the destination register
		<code>rd</code>, in this case, <code>t0</code>.</p>
		<p><strong>EXIT QEMU: ‘Ctrl+A’ then ‘x’</strong></p>
		<p>To run the program, I had to change the <a
		href="/src/Assembly_Hello/Makefile">Makefile</a> so that it would invoke
		my Linux glibc multilib cross-compiler rather than the Newlib 32-bit
		cross-compiler used in the example:</p>
		<pre><code>hello: hello.o link.lds
			riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld -T link.lds -o hello hello.o

		hello.o: hello.s
			riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-as -o hello.o hello.s

		clean:
			rm hello hello.o</code></pre>
		<p>This Makefile takes <code>hello.s</code> as input, then runs it
		through the assembler, which produced the ELF file <code>hello.o</code>,
		and finally ran <code>hello.o</code> through the linker, to produce the
		linked ELF file <code>hello</code>. Now, we are ready to run our program
		in Qemu, which I did with the following:</p>
		<pre><code>$ cd ~/Repos/Qemu
		$ qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -nographic -kernel ~/Desktop/hello</code></pre>
		<p>This produced the following output:</p>
		<pre><code>qemu-system-riscv64: warning: No -bios option specified. Not loading a firmware.
		qemu-system-riscv64: warning: This default will change in a future QEMU release. Please use the -bios option to avoid breakages when this happens.
		qemu-system-riscv64: warning: See QEMU&#39;s deprecation documentation for details.
		Hello</code></pre>
		<p>This only printed “Hello” once, presumably since the
		<code>virt</code> machine only has one core, while the SiFive board used
		in the example has two cores. After printing “Hello”, the processor sat
		there running the infinite loop that finished our assembly program.
		Without this infinite loop, the program counter would continue
		incrementing, which could lead it to execute illegal instructions. Or,
		in more relevant security terms, it could start leaking memory.</p>
		<p>To terminate Qemu, I pressed <code>Ctrl+A</code>, released, then
		pressed <code>X</code>. This sequence of keystrokes produced the
		output:</p>
		<pre><code>QEMU: Terminated</code></pre>
		<p>This gives us a process to execute arbitrary RISC-V assembly programs
		using our Qemu emulator. Next step: generate a trace.</p>
		<h3 id="section-11">2022-07-18</h3>
		<p>Building <code>riscv-tools</code> so that we can use
		<code>riscv-probe</code> to “probe control and status registers.” After
		several failed attempts, I realized that my <code>$RISCV</code>
		environment variable should be set to the directory where my toolchain
		is installed, i.e. <code>/opt/riscv</code>. I also noticed that I needed
		to change some <code>--host</code> flags in <code>build.sh</code> to
		reflect my installation of the Linux glibc toolchain (prefix
		<code>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-</code>, rather than the Newlib
		toolchain with prefix <code>riscv64-unknown-elf-</code>).</p>
		<p>Since I installed my toolchain in a directory that’s restricted, I
		had to use the following command to run the build script:</p>
		<pre><code>$ sudo -E ./build.sh</code></pre>
		<p>I got a compiler error in <code>riscv-pk/pk/pk.c</code>:</p>
		<pre><code>../pk/pk.c: In function &#39;rest_of_boot_loader&#39;:
		../pk/pk.c:139:3: error: both arguments to &#39;__builtin___clear_cache&#39; must be pointers

		<p>The function signature as given by documentation is the
		following:</p>
		<pre><code>void __builtin___clear_cache(void *begin, void *end);</code></pre>
		<p>From the code, I cannot determine what cache is supposed to be
		cleared here. I suppose I <em>could</em> try casting the zeroes to
		<code>int *</code> type:</p>
		<pre><code>__clear_cache((int *)0, (int *)0);</code></pre>
		<h1 id="switching-gears">Switching Gears</h1>
		<p>Let’s look into Qemu features that might allow us to look at register
		values.</p>
		<h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>
		<p>The <code>-monitor</code> flag lets us view the register contents at
		a fixed point in time, by executing <code>info registers</code> in the
		monitor console. However, I do not believe this tool allows us to
		periodically write register values to a file. Unless, of course, I could
		configure a character device driver that sends monitor info to a log
		file. That seems like more trouble than it’s worth, for a result that’s
		less than optimal.</p>
		<h2 id="gdb-gnu-debugger">gdb (GNU Debugger)</h2>
		<p>Launching our emulator with the <code>-s</code> and <code>-S</code>
		flags makes it listen for an incoming TCP connection on port 1234, from
		gdb, and wait until gdb tells it to launch the kernel.</p>
		<p>gdb seems to be having trouble connecting to the runtime with our
		assembly program. I’ll try connecting it to the runtime with Fedora.</p>
		<p>That also seemed to fail. This might be the fact that I’m in the
		wrong directory to look at the <code>vmlinux</code> executable.</p>
		<pre><code>warning: Architecture rejected target-supplied description
		warning: No executable has been specified and target does not support

		<p>GOAL: Get a Python script that starts QEMU and can write commands to
		monitor.</p>
		<h2 id="investigating-singlestep">Investigating singlestep</h2>
		<p>There is a monitor option that runs in “single-step” mode. I have
		attempted to run it on my Hello World program, with no detectable result
		so far.</p>
		<pre><code>$ qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -kernel ~/Desktop/riscv-hello-world/asm/hello -monitor stdio -S
		\[...\]
		(qemu) singlestep
		(qemu) singlestep
		(qemu) info registers
		 pc       0000000000001000
		 \[...\] 
		 f31/ft11 0000000000000000
		(qemu) c</code></pre>
		<p>After the <code>c</code> command instructing the VM to continue, the
		entire “Hello” string printed in the VM window, and there was no
		indication that the execution had paused for single-step execution.</p>
		<p>Looking more deeply at QEMU debugging options, it might be the case
		that <code>-d cpu</code> will write the CPU registers “after the
		execution of each code block.” This could be <em>very</em> helpful.</p>
		<p>The <code>-d cpu</code> option <em>does</em> print the same CSRs as
		monitor shows, but doesn’t include FPRs. The
		<code>-D ./&lt;filename&gt;</code> flag saves a log in the current
		directory. Thus,</p>
		<pre><code>qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -kernel ~/Desktop/riscv-hello-world/asm/hello -monitor stdio -s -S -d cpu -D ./hello_log.txt</code></pre>
		<p>produces the log <a href="/hello_log.txt">hello.txt</a>. A similar
		effect can be achieved with <code>logfile ./hello_log.txt</code> in the
		monitor.</p>

		<h1 id="writing-the-python-wrapper-script">Writing the Python wrapper
		script</h1>
		<p>It looks like the subprocess module for Python is the best way to run
		Qemu inside a Python script, as it gives us flexibility of where to
		route the child process’s stdin, stdout, and stderr.</p>
		<p>That is, assuming I can get it to run Qemu correctly with the flags I
		need. I’ve gotten <code>os.system</code> to function as expected, but am
		yet to figure out how to do the same thing with a subprocess.</p>
		<p>Looking at the documentation, I discovered that
		<code>subprocess.call("*",shell=True)</code> functions as basically a
		1:1 replacement for <code>os.system</code>.</p>
		<h3 id="section-17">2022-07-29</h3>
		<h1 id="understanding-subprocess">Understanding <a
		href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html">Subprocess</a></h1>
		<p>After lots of reading and tinkering with the <code>subprocess</code>
		module, I have discovered a few things.</p>
		<pre><code># The following results in undefined behavior when called on the list args
		# but executes as expected when called on args joined into a single string.
		s = sp.run(shlex.join(args), shell=True, text=True, env=env)</code></pre>
		<p>The following are equivalent (although they have slightly different
		return values):</p>
		<pre><code>os.system(&quot; &quot;.join(args))
		retcode = sp.call(&quot; &quot;.join(args), shell=True)
		s = sp.run(&quot; &quot;.join(args), shell=True, text=True)</code></pre>
		<p>Using <code>shell=True</code> leaves a potential vulnerability to
		shell injection attacks, although using <code>shlex.join()</code>
		mitigates this risk by using a properly shell- escaped command.</p>
		<p>It may be necessary/good practice to copy the environment variables
		into a dictionary before opening the subprocess, and passing that
		dictionary as the <code>env</code> argument.</p>
		<p><code>subprocess.run()</code> waits for the child process to complete
		before moving on to the next line of Python code, however
		<code>subprocess.Popen()</code> “executes a child program in a new
		process.” The new <code>Popen</code> object can then be sent input from
		the parent and have its output read by the parent.</p>
		<p>The child process’s <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and
		<code>stderr</code> can all be sent to an existing file object, or
		through a pipe. For extra flexibility, we will use a pipe.
		<code>subprocess.PIPE</code> is a file object that can handle I/O to and
		from the child.</p>
		<p>Entering <code>Ctrl+D</code> into the terminal without an active
		process closes the window, causing a loss of the information that was
		contained in it.</p>
		<p><code>Popen.communicate()</code> waits for the child process to
		terminate before sending and receiving data. I believe I will want to
		use the <code>Popen</code> object’s I/O streams to send and recieve
		data.</p>

		<h1 id="daikon">Daikon</h1>
		<p>Daikon takes two files as input: a .decls and a .dtrace:</p>
		<h2 id="decls-file">Decls file</h2>
		<p>A .decls containes a header and timepoints.</p>
		<h3 id="timepoints">Timepoints</h3>
		<p>Timepoints contain:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>its type</li>
		<li>elements of state (variables)
		<ul>
		<li>variable kind (variable)</li>
		<li>declaration and representation type</li>
		<li>comparability
		<ul>
		<li>CSRs, GPRs, and FPRs have their own respective comparabilities.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>variable name corresponds to register name</li>
		</ul></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Per Calvin’s recommendation: declare all variables the same way at
		<code>tick():::ENTER</code> and <code>tick():::EXIT0</code>.
		Additionally, give the same values at enter and exit.</p>
		<p>-&gt; Can we have <em>no</em> exit values?</p>
		<h2 id="dtrace-files">dtrace files</h2>
		<p>A .dtrace consists of a bunch of program points.</p>
		<h3 id="program-point">Program point</h3>
		<p>Program points have the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>a name, with enter or exit</li>
		<li>a nonce, which is monotonically increasing (1-indexed)</li>
		<li>every register
		<ul>
		<li>name</li>
		<li>value</li>
		<li>the (believed) hardcoded value 1</li>
		</ul></li>
		</ul>
		<p>There must be a line of whitespace between program points, or Daikon
		will error. Extra whitespace might be allowed, but that minimum must be
		present.</p>
		<p>qtrace -&gt; 1 dtrace, 1 decls</p>
		<h1 id="priorities">Priorities:</h1>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>Get Daikon working and parse qtraces into dtraces</li>
		<li>Run Fedora on SiFive emulation and see if it logs different CSRs.
		-&gt; <em>it doesn’t.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="writing-qtodaikon">Writing qToDaikon</h2>
		<p>This script needs to take a qtrace, preferably <em>either</em> a
		monitor trace <em>or</em> a QEMU log file, and change it into a dtrace.
		At the heart of this problem is parsing our register values into an
		internal data structure, such as a list. Conveniently, a lot of that can
		be handled by this one line of code:</p>
		<pre><code>re.findall(&quot;\w+\s+[0-9a-f]{16}|\w+\s+[0-9a-f]x[0-9a-f]&quot;,line)</code></pre>
		<p>This uses a regular expression to match the labels and registers from
		the qtrace format into a list of strings, where each string has a
		register label/value pair that essentially forms a program point. This
		is something we can quickly comb through and write to a dtrace file.</p>

		<h1 id="installing-daikon">Installing Daikon</h1>
		<p>Following the <a
		href="https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#Installing-Daikon">Daikon
		install instructions</a>, I unpacked the Daikon distribution, like
		so:</p>
		<pre><code>$ mkdir ~/Repos/Daikon
		$ cd ~/Repos/Daikon
		$ wget http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/daikon-5.8.12.tar.gz
		$ tar zxf daikon-5.8.12.tar.gz</code></pre>
		<p>This created a <code>daikon-5.8.12/</code> subdirectory. I then
		executed the following:</p>
		<pre><code>$ export DAIKONDIR=~/Repos/Daikon/daikon-5.8.12
		$ source $DAIKONDIR/scripts/daikon.bashrc</code></pre>
		<p>This output the error message:</p>
		<pre><code>Cannot infer JAVA_HOME; please set it.  Aborting daikon.bashrc .</code></pre>
		<p>I realized I had to install the Java Development Kit, which I did
		with the following:</p>
		<pre><code>$ sudo apt install default-jdk</code></pre>
		<p>and verified installation with:</p>
		<pre><code>$ java -version</code></pre>
		<p>Then, I checked that <code>DAIKONDIR</code> was still set correctly
		with <code>echo</code>, and I repeated the <code>source</code> command
		transcribed above. This no longer returned an error message, and I
		checked that it had set the environment variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code>,
		as a sanity check that it had done its work, and sure enough, I got the
		filepath I expected.</p>
		<h1 id="continuing-qtodaikon">Continuing qToDaikon</h1>
		<p>While troubleshooting the above and waiting for installations to
		finish, I wrote the parts of <code>qToDaikon.py</code> that open a
		<code>.dtrace</code> file for writing, and parse the input into a 2D
		list of timepoints by register name/value strings. Next, we have to take
		this 2D list and parse the strings inside it, then write those register
		names and values into a <code>.dtrace</code> file in the proper
		format.</p>
		<h3 id="section-21">2022-08-04</h3>
		<p>In our <code>qscript</code> output, we notice that we are logging
		duplicate register values at many different timepoints, because we are
		receiving <code>info registers</code> outputs more often than the values
		are actually updated. To find the number of <em>unique</em> timesteps,
		we compare the value of every register at the current timepoint to the
		corresponding value at the previous timepoint using list equality. We
		only append a timepoint to the list of timepoints if it passes this
		uniqueness check.</p>
		<p>Now we have a toolchain to run QEMU, generate a trace, and parse that
		trace into Daikon format. The next step is to generate the
		<code>.decls</code>, which I did with the script
		<code>make_decls.py</code>, which takes lists of the CSRs, GPRs, and
		FPRs, and gives each category its own comparability. This
		<em>should</em> only need to be generated once, and I’ve included the
		resulting <code>universal.decls</code> here, under src/utils.</p>
		<p>Our next step will be to combine <code>qscript.py</code> and
		<code>qToDaikon.py</code> into a single tool, which both runs QEMU on an
		ELF file, <em>and</em> generates a <code>.dtrace</code>. Now that we
		have all the pieces in place, this should go smoothly.</p>
		<h3 id="section-22">2022-08-05</h3>
		<p>Now having a <code>.decls</code> and a <code>.dtrace</code>, I ran
		Daikon on these files:</p>
		<pre><code>java daikon.Daikon ~/Desktop/riscv-tracegen/src/utils/universal.decls ~/Desktop/riscv-tracegen/src/utils/20220801-151842.dtrace</code></pre>
		<p>After a couple of failed attempts, because I had forgotten to include
		proper whitespace in my <code>.dtrace</code>, this run produced the
		output (a list of properties) found in <a
		href="hello_props.txt">hello_props.txt</a>. The properties discovered
		here are exactly what we would expect: most of the registers are equal
		to each other with value 0, and a few were changed to one nonzero value
		(except the program counter <code>pc</code>, which had two nonzero
		values, which, again, is as expected. The registers were also grouped in
		the categories I specified with the <code>comparability</code> property,
		CSRs, GPRs, and FPRs.</p>
		<h1 id="aphrodite">Aphrodite</h1>
		<p>Our overall tool, combining the trace generation from
		<code>qscript</code> and the <code>.dtrace</code> formatting from
		<code>qToDaikon</code>, called Aphrodite, takes a RISC-V executable and
		a timeout in minutes, executing QEMU and writing a well-formatted
		dtrace. I have verified Aphrodite’s correctness with our bare-metal
		hello world program, and will now use Aphrodite to boot Linux with a
		20-minute timeout, to see how much data it generates. After that, I’ll
		run it with a longer timeout (hopefully, 2 hours).</p>
		<p>After much debugging, I was able to get Aphrodite to successfully
		boot Linux. Much to my surprise, the boot process completed in less than
		an hour, and I was able to log in and do a couple basic shell commands
		at the terminal, before engaging the shutdown sequence. This resulted in
		<a href="src/utils/trace/20220805-181853.dtrace">a 15.7 MB trace</a>
		that contains 6,484 program points.</p>
		<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>Figure out what special FP values are (l. 23-34)</li>
