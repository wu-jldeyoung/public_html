# Mathematics Capstone

*2022-10-29*

As part of my mathematics degree, I participated in a capstone research project 
in my senior year. This research was an extension of Rectangle Visibility 
Graphs (RVGs), which we called Cyclops Rectangle Visibility Graphs (CRVGs). Our 
modifications of the standard rectangle visibility problem actually brought us 
closer to a related field, Rectangle-of-Influence Graphs (RIGs). Our [initial 
presentation](Cyclops_RVGs.pdf) on the subject is published here, with the final paper coming soon.
